# heart-attack
we have data on patients seen by cardiologist.  the mailgoal of this notebook isnto build 
a machine learning model, that will be able to predict the  riskof a heart attack on  patient's
health condition.

Here we have the description of thefeatures:

age-age in years

sex-sex(0=female; 1=male)

cp-chest pain type(1 = typical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0=asmptomatic)

trbps-resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on addmission to the hospital)

chol-serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs-fasting blood sugar>120 mg/dl(0=false;1=true)

restecg-resting electrocardiographic results (0=normal; 1 =hypertrophy; 2 =having ST-T wave abnormality)

thalachh-maximum heart rate achieved

exng-exercize induced angina(0=no; 1=yes)

oldpeak-ST depression induced by exercize related to rest

slp-the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0=downsloping; 1=flat;2=upsloping)

caa-number of majorvessels(0-4) colored by floursopy

thall-thallium stress test(1=fixed defect;2=reversable defect;3=normal)

output-0=less chance of heart attack; 1= more  chance of heart attack
